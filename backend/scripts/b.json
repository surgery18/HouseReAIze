	"title": "The Dual Diagnosis",
	"description": "In this gripping episode titled 'The Rare Diagnosis', Dr. House and his team face a puzzling case where the symptoms point towards a combination of Hydrocephaly and trimethylaminuria. As the team delves deeper, they grapple with not only the medical intricacies but also the psychological impact on their patient. Dr. House's unyielding search for truth brings forth a series of revelations, while Cuddy and Wilson provide the emotional and logical counterpoints to his methods. The corridors of Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital resonate with debates, theories, and the quest for a cure. Meanwhile, the patient's distress serves as a stark reminder of the human side of medicine. The episode culminates in a dramatic sequence as the team races against time, combining their expertise to solve yet another medical mystery.",
